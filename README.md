# Internal bracing

Experiment with internal bracing for wings

This is an ellipse with a brace at about 45 degs and with Jeremy's
help from advice in this [thread](https://groups.google.com/g/cadquery/c/dzsvo9R3XdY/m/gUctOXWABAAJ) it's now working.

I experimented with three types of bracing. The first was a plate with lightening holes.
The second was just a collar around the inside of the tube. The third, the present
version, is a collar with a lip. This last version is much stronger than the other two
and I tuned the dimensions so it printed fairly well with a 0.4mm nozzle and PLA.

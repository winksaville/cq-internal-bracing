# Internal bracing

Experiment with internal bracing for wings

This is an ellipse with a brace at about 45 degs and with Jeremy's
help from advice in this [thread](https://groups.google.com/g/cadquery/c/dzsvo9R3XdY/m/gUctOXWABAAJ) it's now working.

Need to "tune" the slicer settings and probably the bracing to print
better, but still a success.

Wirtten in python using the [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) framework.

# Internal bracing

Experiment with internal bracing for wings

This is an ellipse with a brace at about 45 degs and trying to do
something that Jeremy suggested [here](https://groups.google.com/g/cadquery/c/dzsvo9R3XdY/m/gUctOXWABAAJ):

"extend manually that with 2D geometry to create a closed 2D wire and then do a cutThruAll to remove all of the unwanted material"

I get a "IndexError: list index out of range" so obviously this isn't
correct so I'm asking on the list.

Wirtten in python using the [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) framework.
